> An lovely Java project built mainly by Swing, JDBC, and MySql

##### - Swing and JFrame is definitely not easy to use on mac lol, but at least I made it. Yikes!
##### - For Example, the Jtable can't be created automatically using the design tool. To be able to use it, I have to manually write the code for the table and it's just so much of time to spend on...


 - How to copy:
```sh
$ git clone [repo URL]
$ cd ./foldername
```
 - I have packaged the project into a jar file, so it's runnable and easy to use. Just make sure you have your MySql running and JRE configured

- Wanna run it with terminal? Easy!

```sh
$ java -jar [jar file path]
```
